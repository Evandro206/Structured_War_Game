# Structured_War_Game

This repository serves as a record of activities developed during my collegiate Data Structures course. It features one of the key challenges proposed during the semester, with a detailed description of its stages outlined below.

### Building the territories

The mission is to build a database of territories using a composite data structure.

### What will you do?

Create a struct called Territory that will store information such as name, army color, and number of troops. The system will allow the registration of 5 territories and display the data right after filling it out.

### Functional requirements

See the steps to create and manipulate a structure that represents territories in a simple system.

    Struct Creation: define a struct called Territory with the fields char name[30], char cor[10], and int tropas.

    Territory Registration: the system must allow the user to register five territories by informing the name, army color, and the number of troops for each one.

    Data Display: the system must display the information of all registered territories after registration.

### Non-functional requirements

Also include the following criteria to have functional, efficient, and easy-to-understand code:

    Usability: the input interface must be simple and clear, with messages that guide the user on what to type.

    Performance: the system must present the data right after registration, with a response time of less than 2 seconds.

    Documentation: the code must contain explanatory comments about the creation of the struct, data entry, and display.

    Maintainability: the names of variables and functions must be clear and representative, making the code easy to read and maintain.
